# hackathon
This will serve as my submission to the AK Dev Alliance 2019 Hackathon. I decided to pursue the automation front. My submission will monitor a folder on your desktop and automatically post any .jpg's to InstaGram and prompt with a GUI to enter the description.
These submissions can be set to post Monday, Wednesday and Friday so that you can set it and walk away. Keeping your Social Media exposure readily updated.
I have combined this with a few other things in order to up my Memelord status.
GPT-2 has:
We've trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization - all without task-specific training.
I have used auto generated responses from a Google Colab Notebook:

I combined the GPT-2 Colab musings and the InstaAutomator with a third:

Here is an example of some GPT-2's response to the prompt: "John's won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because", pardon the spelling…
Johns won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because it was a near perfect example of the tech he was working on, which he described as "a new kind of computer system." The Memelord platform is an open-source distributed systems platform with an emphasis on the web, the Internet of Things, and cryptographic crypto. In addition to what Johns calls "the internet of things," the Memelord platform is also designed to serve as a universal platform for all kinds of applications that leverage the blockchain for smart contracts, trading, and other ==================== 
Johns won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because of its fast-paced gameplay and customizable arena, and he said he hoped to use the game for school projects and as an alternative to more traditional video games. "We've had so many good submissions and so many really creative ideas," said Williams. "And I'm thrilled with the amount of people who've participated." More than 100 schools, universities and foundations are participating in the Hackathon, which runs through March 22, with nearly 10,000 students registered to take part. ==================== 
Johns won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because of his ability to collaborate. When he was in the States, he spent weeks experimenting with all kinds of prototypes and trying out designs and tryouts. It was a very scary time, and a lot of the time, he wasn't sure what to do with his new company. He put together a design competition that would test his ability to craft unique products that could be sold in a way that wouldn't disrupt the world. The competition required entrants to put together a product and demonstrate how it ==================== 
Johns won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because he found out how to make a metal pattern out of a plastic mold, the process by which plastic is made. "My plans for the art were in my head for quite a while. I had made a few drawings and it was just a matter of how to make it happen. It's a whole new world with metal instead of plastic," said Hansa, who graduated from Yolo Community College with a B.A. in industrial design and manufacturing. Memelord was ==================== 
Johns won the Hackathon with his Memelord creation because it was the easiest and most simple to program. I didn't have to deal with any special hardware, or special software, or any of that kind of stuff. I just had to program it. MELODIV MELODIV is a really nice little app, and one that I'm hoping to be able to use for a lot of different things. The idea is that it allows you to check out a great collection of games. It's like a database. In ====================
